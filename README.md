gpdPerm - genral pareto dist. for permutation testing 
=====================================================

Python module to improve pvalue estimation from a null distribution that is 
approximated by permutation testing. Uses a generalized pereto distribution 
to approximate the tail of the null distribution, as described in 
Knijnenburg 2009.  Authors publicly provided the original analysis as a set of 
matlab scripts.  

To run the full procedure given a test statistic, x0, and a 
vector of permutations, y, call gdpPerm::est(x0,y)

The current version is limited to the maximum likelihood method for performing the fit.
